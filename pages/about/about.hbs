    <p>
      Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 â€“ 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter,
      sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of
      his adult life in France. Regarded as one of the most influential artists
      of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the
      invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for
      the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore.
